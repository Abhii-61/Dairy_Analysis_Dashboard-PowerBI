# Dairy_Analysis_Dashboard-PowerBI
Data Analytics project Dashboard to analyse the sales of a Dairy using PowerBI. 

1. Introduction 
The Dairy Sales Analysis Dashboard was created to analyze dairy product 
performance across various states in India. The objective of this project was to 
understand overall revenue, product-wise sales performance, location-based 
quantities sold, farm-related statistics, and distribution of resources such as land 
area and cows. 
This interactive dashboard was developed in Microsoft Power BI using raw dairy 
sales, product, and farm data. The project provides actionable insights for 
decision-making related to production, distribution, and resource utilization. 
2. Objectives of the Project
